I'm Ivo Uenk and working as a freelance Microsoft IT trainer since 2018. 
Besides working as a trainer, I also have a job as transition engineer at a large hosting company. 
That gives me the opportunity to work with modern techniques and software in advanced company environments and stay up to date about the most recent developments. 
The experience and knowledge I gain by working in those environments, can be used in my workshops to make a clear connection between theory and practice.

My interests are mobile workspaces, device- and application solutions (MDM/ MAM), Azure Virtual Desktop, Microsoft Endpoint Manager and automation.
